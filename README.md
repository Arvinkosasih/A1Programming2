# A1Programming2
Song
This is assignment 1 programming 2, students are told to create a program that is able to show the list of the song, complete the song, adding a new song and quitting the program
When I was doing this project, it is very challenging because I need to research more about python programming language to create this program since my knowledge about python is very low. 
I spent more than a week doing this project as I said before because of the lack of python programming skills. I spent more on research than doing the project, and forgot to commit my project one by one to github.
